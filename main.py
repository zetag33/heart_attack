    # and that might be why one of them is 0 and the other 1, it's good to find that groups are different statistically.
    #- The variable trtbps for the group 0 does not follow a normal distribution.
    #- The variable thalachh for group 1 does not follow a normal distribution.
    #- The variable oldpeak does not follow a normal distribution for any of the groups.
    #- The variable oldpeak does not have homogeneity of variances in both groups.
    # - All the variables that have not been mentioned above follow a normal distribution and have homogeneity of variances between both groups.
